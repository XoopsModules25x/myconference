myConference XOOPS' module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Date: July/2004

This module will help you organize a congress or conference.
The idea is that you can add a congress, the tracks, the
speekers information and the speeches that they give. When
all this information is entered in the database, the module
will create a grid for you with all the information well organized.

Currently the module lacks of a lot o features I will like it
to have, but anyway, it's better to realease something usefull
than have a great project in paper.

Features:
- Automatic speeches' program grid creation
- Multiple tracks, sections, speekers, speeches supported
- Languages english and spanish
- Multiple congresses supported (but only one can be shown at a time)

:Short explanation:
    First you need to add a congress/conference with start and end
date.
    A Conference (or conference) is the whole event, the grid will
only show the speeches that are between this conference start and
end date. So be careful not to place a speech outside the congress'
dates.
    A track is something used at congresses to organize the speeches,
the idea is that a particular person won't have to face (at least too
many times) the ``wannabe at two different speeches at the same time´´.
So what you do is organize the speeches in thematic tracks (like:
Programming, System Administration, Security, Documentation, Philosophy).
The tracks are shown verticaly, throught all the congress, and you can't
have a speech that belongs to two different tracks (sorry, that's not
implemented yet). So be carefull not to have too many tracks (4, maybe 5 at
the most is recommended).
    There're also the sections, these are specificaly for congress information
data. Things like "Hotels close to the event", "Location", "Who's giving
this event", "Sponsors", anything directly related with the event. These
sections will show as a header for almost every page.
    The speekers information is independent of the congress it self, so you
can reutilize this person information in another event.
    The speeches have a strong relation with the congress, track and speeker, so
is the last thing you will fill out.

Well, I know it's a short description but its a start.

Any comments, suggestions and ideas feel free to report them to me.
And thanks for using it.
